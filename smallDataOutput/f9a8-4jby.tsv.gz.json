Additionally, in partnership with the Center for Strategic Solutions at NYU, ESI hosted a Critically Conscious Educators Rising (CCER) Series that convened a group of like-minded educators to focus on tying theory to practice in the pursuit of equity and racial justice in their classrooms, through their peers, and beyond. Through the ESI Leadership Institute, the DOE hosted a four-part collaborative series bringing together principals and assistant principals to explore systematic bias and racism in schools and what building leaders can do to disrupt it.

Many schools have implemented teacher inter-visitations, encouraging the sharing of best practices in how to most effectively serve a diverse school community.
